# Rubik's Cube with Hand Gesture Controls

This interactive application lets users control and solve Rubik's Cube with hand gestures with the help of their webcam. 

---

## How to Use the Application
After camera is turned on and the application is loaded, user can immediately start using it.
### Main Controls

1. **Shuffling the cube**  
   - As the cube starts off solved, first course of action is to shuffle it. To do so, you can make a "Thumb's up" gesture. Cube will then start to shuffle with animations.

2. **Selecting Axis**  
   - Now you can start solving the Cube by first selecting an axis. To do so, you can make "pinch" gesture with index finger and thumb. This will toggle through x,y,z axis.
3. **Selecting Face**  
   - Once axis is selected, you can select the face you want to actually rotate. To do so, you can make "rock n' roll" gesture (Middle finger and ring finger are substracted while other fingers are extended).
4. **Rotations**
   - First kind of rotation is obviously face rotation. To rotate the face, you can make a swipe gesture (quickly move your hand in one direction). This works in both ways.
   - Second kind of rotation is rotation of the whole cube. You can rotate the cube around, so you can see the current state it's in at the given moment. To do so, you can make a "fist" gesture and move your hand around. Once you "release" the cube (read: extend your hand) the cube will stop rotating.
